Problem statement : 

Plant diseases can spread rapidly and have significant impacts on agriculture, gardens, and natural ecosystems. Without timely and accurate tracking, it becomes challenging to manage and mitigate these outbreaks effectively. Identifying patterns and understanding the spread of diseases is crucial for taking preventive measures and coordinating responses within communities.

Solution Overview:

The proposed solution is to develop a Java-based application that enables users to report and manage information about plant diseases. The application will use a MySQL database to store and organize data related to plant diseases, which can then be analyzed to identify trends and outbreaks.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

User Reporting:

Users can log into the application and submit reports about plant diseases they encounter.
Each report includes details such as the type of plant affected, the disease identified, the location of the outbreak, and any treatment used.
Database Storage:

The MySQL database will have several tables:

users: Stores user information for authentication and tracking.
plant_diseases: Contains data about different plant diseases, including symptoms and treatments.

disease_reports: 

Records individual disease reports from users, including plant type, disease, location, and treatment.
Data Analysis and Visualization:

The system can generate reports to summarize disease data, such as frequency of reports, common diseases, and locations with outbreaks.
Maps can be created to visualize the geographic distribution of disease reports, helping to identify hotspots and patterns.

Key Benefits:

Early Detection: Helps in detecting disease outbreaks early, allowing for quicker response and mitigation.
